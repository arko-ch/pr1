## git

Always push/pull from the  `origin/development` branch.

## functional components

Components should be functional components whenever possible. 
Stateful components either use ``React.useState`` or ```React.useContext```, or wrapped with stateful container components:

```jsx
	export default MyComponent(props) {
		const [ myColor, setMyColor ] = React.useState({ myColor: 'red' })
		return <div>{myColor}</div>
	}
```

## prettier

At every git commit ```prettier``` is run on edited code (through husky). Formatting is therefore prettier-opinion.

## scss & css

The build environment include ```PostCss``` with the ```App.scss``` as entry point of all scss.

```assets/App.css``` is generated by PostCss only at the call of  ```yarn build:css``` or only once at ```yarn start```

To auto build the css during development, run ```yarn watch:css``` at a separate process.

Alternatively, put all css under testing or development in ```Test.scss``` this is watched by webpack and rebuilds automatically on change.

Always migrate styles in test.css to the App.scss tree when they have been confirmed ready.
