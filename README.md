# husky

whenever a source file is committed, prettier is automatically run to format it

# postcss

postcss is now used to process scss files. it generates ./src/assets/App.css
when testing css, use Test.scss. make sure to transfer changes to files under ./src/assets/.scss
never edit ./src/assets/App.css . this file is autogenerated by postcss
